                I'm a Software Engineer with a decade experience in industry, in verticals from   
                consumer finance, e-commerce, digital agriculture, and solar energy. 
                My work has ranged from ... to .... .

                I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a decade of experience across the full technology spectrumâ€”from seed-stage startups to publicly traded companies like Etsy and Tesla-acquired SolarCity. I've built and scaled systems serving millions of users, from mobile apps and payment platforms to data pipelines processing terabytes of agricultural data.

            <p>
                My work spans the entire stack: optimizing Rails backends that reduced KYC errors by 80%, building React Native apps as the sole mobile developer, and architecting AWS data infrastructure. I thrive in fast-moving environments where I can work directly with founders and technical leaders to ship features that drive real business impact.

            <p>I've shipped production code at every stage; from seed startups and 
                series A/B, to  
                publicly traded companies; moving comfortably between front-end 
                polish
                 to back-end scale.

                After immigrating from Amsterdam to Baltimore in 2011, he then arrived in Silicon Valley for an 
                internship at WePay, a consumer payments company. He realized he was a Technologist at heart, and fell 
                in love with the culture of Silicon Valley and technology thinking in general. 
                Over the decade ahead, he would work for 
                companies ranging from seed-stage to public, on teams small and large, scrappy and quick-moving versus 
                larger and highly structured. He has always sought to apply his passion and skill for applied mathematics, 
                developing an interest in machine learning and other areas of overlap between math and code.

                for a rapidly growing startup, on a product with a powerful mission. 
                He is also pursuing a part-time, online MSc. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech ("OMCS").
                As if that were not enough, he aspires to someday attend Johns Hopkins' Master's program 
                for Applied and Computational Mathematics.
                He likes to write (on this very website), code (GitHub whenever there is time), and read (see section above). -->

                at a Palo Alto payments startup in 2012, marking his professional start in the
