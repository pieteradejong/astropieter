                Pieter de Jong is a Software Engineer with a decade experience in industry, in verticals from   
                consumer finance, e-commerce, digital agriculture, and solar energy. 
                My work has ranged from ... to .... .                
                


                <!-- He started programming 
                at a young age on pre-Pentium PCs, when Windows 3.11 was the standard and noisy modems 
                connected you to the Altavista "directory of the Internet." Professionally, he started doing front-end 
                Web development, growing into fullstack development over time.  -->
            </p>


            <p>Iâ€™ve shipped production code at every stage; from seed startups and 
                series A/b, to  
                publicly traded companies; moving comfortably between front-end 
                polish
                 to back-end scale. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After immigrating from Amsterdam to Baltimore in 2011, he then arrived in Silicon Valley for an 
                internship at WePay, a consumer payments company. He realized he was a Technologist at heart, and fell 
                in love with the culture of Silicon Valley and technology thinking in general. 
                Over the decade ahead, he would work for 
                companies ranging from seed-stage to public, on teams small and large, scrappy and quick-moving versus 
                larger and highly structured. He has always sought to apply his passion and skill for applied mathematics, 
                developing an interest in machine learning and other areas of overlap between math and code.

                <!-- Recently, he is working as a Senior Software Engineer and first outside technical hire, 
                for a rapidly growing startup, on a product with a powerful mission. 
                He is also pursuing a part-time, online MSc. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech ("OMCS").
                As if that were not enough, he aspires to someday attend Johns Hopkins' Master's program 
                for Applied and Computational Mathematics.
                He likes to write (on this very website), code (GitHub whenever there is time), and read (see section above). -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- He is currently located in Miami, having previously lived in NYC, San Francisco, 
                Palo Alto (Silicon Valley), and Baltimore. Before that, in 2011 he immigrated 
                to Baltimore from Amsterdam, and got an internship 
                at a Palo Alto payments startup in 2012, marking his professional start in the 
                tech world and his acquaintance with Silicon Valley. -->

                My interest also include skiing, snowboarding, geopolitics, physical fitness, (some CKO kickboxing a while ago), linguistics, and spiritual growth.
                I kindly invite you to hit Contact if you're interested in any of those topics.
