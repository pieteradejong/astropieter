**What:** LaTeX is a markup language for mathematical notation, uniquitous in academia and beyond.

**Why:** The examples below show how math can be readibly displayed using LaTeX, as opposed to awkwardly inserting images, or using English-alphabet characters to describe things.

**How:** I learned LaTeX notation in high school and University, as do most. And for this website, this blog post explains how:

Equality:
$$a = b$$

Integral:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} = \sqrt{\pi}$$

Shannon's Entropy:

$$H(x) = \mathbb{E}_{X ~ P}[I(x)] = -\mathbb{E}_{X ~ P}[log P(x)]$$

Sigmoid function:

$$\frac{1}{1 + \exp{-x}}$$

Euler's identity:

$$e^{i\pi} = -1$$

Classic Greek alphabet:

$\alpha,  \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon$

$\Gamma, \Pi, \Sigma$
